# VirtualCockpits
Used for Helios Profiles and other artefacts for Touch Screen Cockpits
There are a lot of great virtual cockpits for DCS World aircraft, but usually they need to be tweaked a little to suit my set-up.  This repository
holds profiles that I have created from scratch as well as profiles from others that have been altered to accommodate my particular needs.
